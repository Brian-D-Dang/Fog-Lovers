However, this is a labor intensive task and creates and extreme human reasource bottleneck. To avoid this issue we used machine learning models to classify images by fog presence automatically. We tested both site-specific models trained only on examples for the given site and general models which were trained on data from other sites. Below you can see the performance of these models for diurnal and nocturnal imagery.')
